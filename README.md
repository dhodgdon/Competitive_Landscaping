# Overview

This repository holds two different javascript projects that I created to improve my JavaScript skills.

The first project is a file containing a function that recursively adds the items in an array. It also contains some native array ES6 functions.

The second project is the beginnings of a website for a new landscaping business. There is an accordion menu created using JavaScript on the home page, the code for which I used from W3Schools (with my own styling). There is also a simple cost estimate calculator (also created with JavaScript) that can be found by clicking on the first item in the accordion menu and following the link.
